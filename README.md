Java 8 - Lambda expression usage

1. Arithmetic Operations using Lambda
2. Sorting List using Lambda




NOTE : Eclipse + Git
1. Clone the git repository in the local machine
2. Import the corresponding projects
3. Do changes and try to push and commit into existing repo
   [If https connection to github push is not working try ssh
   change Winodws->preferences->git[teams]->configuration
   -> repo config->origin url-> change to ssh] 
4. In the underlying it needs ssh-keys to authenticate itself with github 
5. So if id_rsa doesnt exist in .ssh folder then generate one and add
   the public key to the github so that it can authenticate pushes from
   the local machine
   [account->settings->ssh keys->create new key with pub key contents]
6. Enter github credentials in eclipse as needed to connect to it
7. This helps in seamless integration of any code from anywhere
