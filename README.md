# Warmup_pgms

Java 8 - Lambda expression usage

1. Arithmetic Operations using Lambda
2. Sorting List using Lambda




NOTE : Eclipse + Git
1. Clone the git repository in the local machine
2. Import the corresponding projects
3. Do changes and try to push and commit into existing repo
4. Even though we use the Warmup pgms https link - in the 
   underlying it needs ssh-keys to authenticate the machine 
5. So if id_rsa doesnt exist in .ssh then generate one and add
   the public key to the github so that it can authenticate pushes
   [account->settings->ssh keys->create new key with pub key contents]
6. Enter github credentials in eclipse as needed to connect to it
